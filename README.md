## The Application of Linear Mixed Model and Generalized Linear Mixed Model
This is a course report the STA303, Methods for Data Analysis, at the University of Toronto.

Q1
Linear Mixed Model
Use scatter plot to examine the relationship between 7 variables and  language scores. 
Fit a linear mixed model, set different schools as random effect. 
Calculate the variance of random effect and mixed effect, and plot the random effect to check if itâ€™s reasonable. 
Find out most significant variable associate with response variable language score. 
Build a 95% confidence interval for the linear mixed model. 

As a conclusion, the language scores of students from same school are strongly related, 
and the individual IQ, status of their family are key variables associated with their test score.

Q2 
Generalized Gamma Linear Mixed Model
The dataset is from the 2014 American National Youth Tobacco Survey, 
set whether the person smoke or not as response variable, 
build a generalized gamma linear mixed model using a login function.
Set age, sex, area, race as flxed effect, state and school as random effect.
Exam the hypothesis that state-level differences in chewing tabacoo usage amongst high school students, 
are much larger than difference between schools within a state.
